        <div class="about-article">
            <p>My name is Olha, since 
            childhood Iâ€™ve been creating 
            things around me and from that 
            time I understood that this 
            sphere will become my 
            profession. I have a background 
            in Interior design and Architecture, 
            but in the last couple of years, 
            I focused on Graphic design and 
            Web development. I love all kinds 
            of visual design, mobile and web 
            projects, typography, branding 
            and animation. With my 
            experience in design, 
            I know how to make a standing 
            out and eye-catching design.</p>
