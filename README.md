Integrated Assignment - Portfolio
Hosted Portfolio Website

http://olhaboiko.com/

## Description

This is the portfolio website that I developed in purpose to present my work and skillset (as a designer and a little bit as a developer) to potential clients and employers. Final integrated assignment of the third term in IDP program in Fanshawe.

## Functionality

This is a 4-pages dynamic website that has a responsive design. The website has an SQL database and all information in the portfolio section is retrieving from the database into hbs file. The dynamic data is appeared by clicking on the "read more" button when you hover portfolio pieces. There are all kinds of animation and transitions applied to all buttons, lightboxes, texts, navigation, logos, and social media icons.
